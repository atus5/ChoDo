    | your Laravel application. When CORS is enabled for a given path,
    | specified headers and methods are allowed on cross-origin requests.
    |
    | You are free to adjust these settings as needed. However, you should
    | be careful when modifying these - you could inadvertently break
    | parts of your application if misconfigured.
